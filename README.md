# Overview

In Sprint #3, I wrote a cryptography class for encrypting/decrypting text. To demo this project, I created a console application. (You can find that project and its documentation here: [applied-programming-encrypt-decrypt](https://github.com/ScratchyPDX/applied-programming-encrypt-decrypt)). 

However, it occurred to me that, in today's business environment, a console application would not fly as it was not user friendly or portable. So, I looked at writing a frontend project that would meet the following goals:
- It would need to be a desktop application
- It would the ability to run on multiple OSs
- It would need to use the Crypto class from sprint #3 as a DLL



{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
